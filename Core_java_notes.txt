----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on Java Introduction for interview preparation:

1 Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now Oracle. It was first released in 1995.

2 Key features of Java include:
    1 Object-Oriented Everything in Java is an object or revolves around objects.
    2 Platform Independent Code compiled once can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine JVM. This is known as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA.
    3 Simple It avoids complex features like explicit pointers and operator overloading.
    4 Secure Java uses a security manager for secure execution of untrusted code.
    5 Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and exception handling make it robust.
    6 Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
    7 High Performance Achieved through the use of Just-In-Time JIT compilers.

3 Java Platform Components:
    1 Java Virtual Machine JVM An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode.
    2 Java Runtime Environment JRE Consists of the JVM plus Java core classes and supporting files. It is used to run Java applications.
    3 Java Development Kit JDK Includes the JRE plus development tools such as the compiler javac and debugger. It is used to develop Java applications.

4 How Java Code Executes:
    1 Java source code a .java file is written by the developer.
    2 The `javac` compiler translates the source code into bytecode a .class file.
    3 The bytecode is then executed by the JVM which interprets or JIT compiles it into machine-specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

5 Applications of Java:
    1 Android Applications Mobile apps are primarily developed using Java.
    2 Web Applications Technologies like Servlets JSP Spring and Hibernate are used for web development.
    3 Enterprise Applications Large-scale business applications in finance banking and e-commerce.
    4 Desktop Applications Using frameworks like Swing and JavaFX.
    5 Big Data Technologies Hadoop Spark and Kafka extensively use Java.
    6 Scientific Applications Used for numerical computations and simulations.
