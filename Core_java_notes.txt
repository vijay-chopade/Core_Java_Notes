Java Introduction Notes for Interview Preparation

1.  What is Java
    Java is a high level object oriented platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now owned by Oracle. It is known for its Write Once Run Anywhere capability. It is widely used for enterprise level applications mobile development especially Android web applications and big data technologies.

2.  History of Java
    Java was initially started by James Gosling and his team in 1991 as part of the Green Project. It was originally named Oak. It was later renamed Java in 1995.

3.  Key Features or Why Java
    1.  Platform Independent Code compiled on one OS can run on any other OS with a JVM.
    2.  Object Oriented Language based on classes and objects supports inheritance polymorphism abstraction and encapsulation.
    3.  Simple Syntax similar to C plus plus making it easier to learn.
    4.  Secure Strong security features including a sandbox environment and bytecode verifier.
    5.  Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and exception handling.
    6.  Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
    7.  High Performance Achieved through the Just In Time JIT compiler.
    8.  Distributed Designed for network based applications allowing for distributed computing.
    9.  Rich API and large community support.

4.  Java Platform Components
    1.  JVM Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It is responsible for converting Java bytecode into machine specific code and executing it. It also manages memory through garbage collection.
    2.  JRE Java Runtime Environment Contains the JVM and core class libraries. It is what you need to run Java applications. It does not include development tools.
    3.  JDK Java Development Kit Includes the JRE along with development tools like the compiler javac debugger jdb and archiver jar. It is what you need to develop Java applications.

5.  How Java Works Write Once Run Anywhere
    1.  Java source code written in a dot java file is compiled by the javac compiler into platform independent bytecode stored in a dot class file.
    2.  This bytecode can then be executed by any JVM on any operating system.
    3.  The JVM translates the bytecode into machine specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

6.  Basic Program Structure
    1.  Every Java program must have at least one class.
    2.  The entry point for execution of a Java application is the public static void main String[] args method.
    3.  Code statements typically end with a semicolon.

2025-12-01 → Features of Java
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on the features of Java for interview preparation

1  Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn and understand. It removes complex features found in other languages like explicit pointers operator overloading and multiple inheritance. This simplicity makes development faster and reduces errors.

2  Object-Oriented
Java fully embraces the object-oriented programming paradigm. Everything in Java except primitive types is an object. It supports core OOP concepts such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.

3  Platform Independent
This is a key feature often described as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA. Java source code is compiled into bytecode which can then be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine JVM without modification.

4  Secure
Java is designed with security in mind. It provides a secure environment for running applications by using a security manager bytecode verifier and by eliminating explicit pointers to prevent unauthorized memory access.

5  Robust
Java is a robust language designed for reliability. It features strong memory management automatic garbage collection for memory cleanup and powerful exception handling mechanisms to prevent common programming errors and crashes.

6  Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading allowing multiple parts of a program to execute concurrently. This feature helps in building highly responsive and efficient applications by improving performance and resource utilization.

7  High Performance
Java achieves high performance through the use of Just-In-Time JIT compilers. The JIT compiler converts Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime which can then be executed at high speed.

8  Distributed
Java is designed for creating distributed applications. It has extensive networking capabilities and provides tools like Remote Method Invocation RMI which allows objects to communicate with each other across a network.

9  Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language meaning it can adapt to an evolving environment. It supports dynamic loading of classes allowing code to be updated on the fly without needing to recompile the entire application.

10 Portable
Due to its platform independence Java bytecode can be carried to any platform and executed without any modifications. This makes Java code highly portable across different operating systems and hardware.

11 Interpreted
While Java code is first compiled into bytecode this bytecode is then interpreted by the JVM at runtime. This interpretation step combined with JIT compilation contributes to its portability and helps with debugging.

2025-12-02 → JVM, JRE, JDK
----------------------------------------
JVM JRE JDK Short Notes for Interview Preparation

JVM

1 JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
2 It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
3 The JVM converts Java bytecode into machine specific language.
4 It is platform dependent. This means a JVM for Windows is different from a JVM for Linux.
5 Key functions include loading code verifying code executing code and managing memory through garbage collection.
6 It uses a Just In Time JIT compiler for performance optimization by compiling frequently used bytecode into native machine code.

JRE

1 JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
2 It is an implementation of the JVM.
3 JRE consists of the JVM plus a set of core libraries and other supporting files needed to run Java applications.
4 If you only want to run a Java program you need JRE.
5 JRE does not include development tools like compilers javac or debuggers.

JDK

1 JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
2 It is a software development environment used for developing Java applications.
3 JDK includes the JRE and a set of development tools.
4 If you want to develop and run Java programs you need JDK.
5 Key development tools included are javac the compiler java the application launcher jar the archiver and javadoc the documentation generator.

Relationship

1 The relationship can be seen as a nested structure.
2 JDK contains JRE.
3 JRE contains JVM.
4 So the hierarchy is JDK contains JRE which contains JVM.
5 JDK is for both developing and running Java applications.
6 JRE is solely for running Java applications.
7 JVM is the core component that executes the bytecode.

2025-12-06 → Java Installation
----------------------------------------
Java Installation Notes for Interview Preparation

1.  Java installation involves setting up the Java Development Kit JDK on your system. This enables you to write, compile, and run Java applications.

2.  Understanding JDK and JRE:
    *   JDK Java Development Kit: Essential for Java developers. It includes the Java Runtime Environment JRE, a compiler javac, debuggers, and other development tools.
    *   JRE Java Runtime Environment: Used by end-users to run Java applications. It contains the Java Virtual Machine JVM and core class libraries.

3.  Installation Steps:
    *   Download JDK: Obtain the correct JDK version for your operating system from official sources like Oracle or OpenJDK distributions.
    *   Run Installer: Execute the downloaded installer file and follow the guided prompts. The installer will place Java files in a default location, for example C:\Program Files\Java.
    *   Configure Environment Variables:
        *   JAVA_HOME: Create a new system environment variable named JAVA_HOME. Set its value to the root directory of your JDK installation, for example C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.
        *   PATH: Append %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your system's PATH environment variable. This enables running Java commands like java and javac from any command prompt location.
    *   Verify Installation: Open a command prompt or terminal and type `java -version` and `javac -version`. Both commands should display the installed Java version successfully.

4.  Important Commands and Concepts:
    *   javac: The Java compiler. It converts .java source code files into .class bytecode files.
    *   java: The Java application launcher. It executes .class bytecode files using the JVM.
    *   JVM Java Virtual Machine: An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It is the core component of the JRE and enables Java's platform independence.
    *   JAVA_HOME vs PATH: JAVA_HOME explicitly points to the JDK root directory, which is often used by build tools. PATH tells the operating system where to find executable commands like java and javac.

2025-12-10 → First Java Program
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on First Java Program suitable for interview preparation.

1 Every Java application must have at least one class definition. This class will contain the main method.

2 The file containing your Java source code should be saved with a .java extension. The class containing the main method should typically have the same name as the file for simplicity and convention (e.g., MyProgram.java contains class MyProgram).

3 The main method is the entry point for any Java application. The Java Virtual Machine JVM starts execution from this method. Its signature is always public static void mainString[] args.

4 Breakdown of the main method signature:
   public: An access specifier making the method visible to the JVM.
   static: Allows the main method to be called without creating an object of the class. It belongs to the class itself.
   void: Indicates that the main method does not return any value.
   main: The name of the method recognized by the JVM as the application's entry point.
   String[] args: An array of String objects that can receive command line arguments passed to the program.

5 To print output to the console, we use System.out.println("Your message here");.
   System: A final class from the java.lang package.
   out: A static member of the System class, an instance of PrintStream.
   println: A method of the PrintStream class that prints a string and then a new line character.

6 Steps to compile and run your first Java program:
   Write the source code in a text editor and save it as MyProgram.java.
   Open a terminal or command prompt.
   Compile the program using the Java compiler: javac MyProgram.java. This command translates the source code into bytecode and creates a .class file (e.g., MyProgram.class).
   Execute the program using the Java launcher: java MyProgram. This command tells the JVM to load and execute the bytecode from the MyProgram.class file.

7 Key concepts demonstrated by the first program:
   JVM Java Virtual Machine: The runtime environment that executes Java bytecode.
   JRE Java Runtime Environment: Contains the JVM and standard libraries needed to run Java applications.
   JDK Java Development Kit: Includes the JRE and development tools like the javac compiler, needed to develop Java applications.
   Bytecode: The platform-independent intermediate code generated by the compiler.
   Platform Independence: Java's write once, run anywhere WORA capability, where bytecode can be executed on any platform with a compatible JVM.
