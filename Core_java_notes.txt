----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on Java Introduction for interview preparation:

1 Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now Oracle. It was first released in 1995.

2 Key features of Java include:
    1 Object-Oriented Everything in Java is an object or revolves around objects.
    2 Platform Independent Code compiled once can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine JVM. This is known as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA.
    3 Simple It avoids complex features like explicit pointers and operator overloading.
    4 Secure Java uses a security manager for secure execution of untrusted code.
    5 Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and exception handling make it robust.
    6 Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
    7 High Performance Achieved through the use of Just-In-Time JIT compilers.

3 Java Platform Components:
    1 Java Virtual Machine JVM An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode.
    2 Java Runtime Environment JRE Consists of the JVM plus Java core classes and supporting files. It is used to run Java applications.
    3 Java Development Kit JDK Includes the JRE plus development tools such as the compiler javac and debugger. It is used to develop Java applications.

4 How Java Code Executes:
    1 Java source code a .java file is written by the developer.
    2 The `javac` compiler translates the source code into bytecode a .class file.
    3 The bytecode is then executed by the JVM which interprets or JIT compiles it into machine-specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

5 Applications of Java:
    1 Android Applications Mobile apps are primarily developed using Java.
    2 Web Applications Technologies like Servlets JSP Spring and Hibernate are used for web development.
    3 Enterprise Applications Large-scale business applications in finance banking and e-commerce.
    4 Desktop Applications Using frameworks like Swing and JavaFX.
    5 Big Data Technologies Hadoop Spark and Kafka extensively use Java.
    6 Scientific Applications Used for numerical computations and simulations.

2025-12-01 → Features of Java
----------------------------------------
Java is widely recognized for its strong set of features that contribute to its popularity and versatility in software development. Here are some of its core features:

1 Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn and use. It simplifies programming by removing complex features like explicit pointers operator overloading and multiple inheritance from C++.

2 Object-Oriented
Java is a pure object-oriented programming language. It adheres to the principles of Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism and Abstraction enabling modular reusable and maintainable code.

3 Platform Independent
This is a key feature often referred to as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA. Java source code is compiled into an intermediate bytecode which can then be executed on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine JVM installed regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware.

4 Secure
Java offers a robust security architecture. Features like the bytecode verifier security manager and the absence of explicit pointers help prevent unauthorized access and protect against malicious code.

5 Robust
Java is known for its reliability. It achieves robustness through strong memory management automatic garbage collection for memory deallocation exception handling to manage runtime errors and strong type checking.

6 Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading allowing multiple parts of a program to execute concurrently. This improves the performance and responsiveness of applications by efficiently utilizing CPU resources.

7 Portable
Java bytecode can be executed on any platform with a JVM. Furthermore Java defines fixed sizes for its primitive data types ensuring that applications behave consistently across different operating systems.

8 High Performance
While initially interpreted Java uses a Just-In-Time JIT compiler that converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This dynamic compilation significantly boosts the execution speed of Java applications.

9 Distributed
Java is designed to facilitate distributed computing. Its networking capabilities enable the creation of applications that can run across multiple computers on a network allowing for the development of distributed systems.

10 Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language that can adapt to evolving environments. It supports dynamic class loading and reflection allowing applications to discover and incorporate new types of objects or modules at runtime.

11 Automatic Memory Management
Java automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation through its garbage collector. Developers are freed from manual memory management tasks which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related errors.
