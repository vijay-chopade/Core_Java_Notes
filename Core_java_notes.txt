Java Introduction Notes for Interview Preparation

1.  What is Java
    Java is a high level object oriented platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now owned by Oracle. It is known for its Write Once Run Anywhere capability. It is widely used for enterprise level applications mobile development especially Android web applications and big data technologies.

2.  History of Java
    Java was initially started by James Gosling and his team in 1991 as part of the Green Project. It was originally named Oak. It was later renamed Java in 1995.

3.  Key Features or Why Java
    1.  Platform Independent Code compiled on one OS can run on any other OS with a JVM.
    2.  Object Oriented Language based on classes and objects supports inheritance polymorphism abstraction and encapsulation.
    3.  Simple Syntax similar to C plus plus making it easier to learn.
    4.  Secure Strong security features including a sandbox environment and bytecode verifier.
    5.  Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and exception handling.
    6.  Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
    7.  High Performance Achieved through the Just In Time JIT compiler.
    8.  Distributed Designed for network based applications allowing for distributed computing.
    9.  Rich API and large community support.

4.  Java Platform Components
    1.  JVM Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It is responsible for converting Java bytecode into machine specific code and executing it. It also manages memory through garbage collection.
    2.  JRE Java Runtime Environment Contains the JVM and core class libraries. It is what you need to run Java applications. It does not include development tools.
    3.  JDK Java Development Kit Includes the JRE along with development tools like the compiler javac debugger jdb and archiver jar. It is what you need to develop Java applications.

5.  How Java Works Write Once Run Anywhere
    1.  Java source code written in a dot java file is compiled by the javac compiler into platform independent bytecode stored in a dot class file.
    2.  This bytecode can then be executed by any JVM on any operating system.
    3.  The JVM translates the bytecode into machine specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

6.  Basic Program Structure
    1.  Every Java program must have at least one class.
    2.  The entry point for execution of a Java application is the public static void main String[] args method.
    3.  Code statements typically end with a semicolon.

2025-12-01 → Features of Java
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on the features of Java for interview preparation

1  Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn and understand. It removes complex features found in other languages like explicit pointers operator overloading and multiple inheritance. This simplicity makes development faster and reduces errors.

2  Object-Oriented
Java fully embraces the object-oriented programming paradigm. Everything in Java except primitive types is an object. It supports core OOP concepts such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.

3  Platform Independent
This is a key feature often described as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA. Java source code is compiled into bytecode which can then be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine JVM without modification.

4  Secure
Java is designed with security in mind. It provides a secure environment for running applications by using a security manager bytecode verifier and by eliminating explicit pointers to prevent unauthorized memory access.

5  Robust
Java is a robust language designed for reliability. It features strong memory management automatic garbage collection for memory cleanup and powerful exception handling mechanisms to prevent common programming errors and crashes.

6  Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading allowing multiple parts of a program to execute concurrently. This feature helps in building highly responsive and efficient applications by improving performance and resource utilization.

7  High Performance
Java achieves high performance through the use of Just-In-Time JIT compilers. The JIT compiler converts Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime which can then be executed at high speed.

8  Distributed
Java is designed for creating distributed applications. It has extensive networking capabilities and provides tools like Remote Method Invocation RMI which allows objects to communicate with each other across a network.

9  Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language meaning it can adapt to an evolving environment. It supports dynamic loading of classes allowing code to be updated on the fly without needing to recompile the entire application.

10 Portable
Due to its platform independence Java bytecode can be carried to any platform and executed without any modifications. This makes Java code highly portable across different operating systems and hardware.

11 Interpreted
While Java code is first compiled into bytecode this bytecode is then interpreted by the JVM at runtime. This interpretation step combined with JIT compilation contributes to its portability and helps with debugging.
