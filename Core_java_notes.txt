Java Introduction Interview Notes

1 What is Java
Java is a high-level object-oriented platform-independent programming language. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems now Oracle. Java is known for its robustness security and scalability in application development.

2 Key Features of Java
Object-Oriented Based on objects and classes supporting encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.
Platform Independent Write Once Run Anywhere WORA achieved through the Java Virtual Machine JVM.
Simple Designed with a clean syntax avoiding complex features like explicit pointers.
Secure Provides built-in security features bytecode verification and absence of explicit pointers.
Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and comprehensive exception handling.
Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
High Performance Achieved through Just-In-Time JIT compilers that optimize bytecode execution.
Distributed Designed for network-centric computing.

3 JVM JRE JDK Explained
JVM Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It is the component responsible for Java's platform independence.
JRE Java Runtime Environment Consists of the JVM and Java class libraries. It is necessary to run Java applications.
JDK Java Development Kit The complete development kit for Java. It includes the JRE a compiler javac debugger and other development tools needed to develop Java applications.

4 How Java achieves Platform Independence WORA
Java source code stored in a .java file is first compiled into platform-independent bytecode stored in a .class file by the javac compiler.
This bytecode is then interpreted and executed by the platform-specific JVM on the target operating system.
Since the bytecode is independent of the underlying hardware or operating system Java programs can run on any device with a compatible JVM without needing to be recompiled.

5 Basic Java Program Compilation and Execution Flow
1 Write your Java source code in a .java file for example MyProgram.java.
2 Compile the source code using the JDK's javac compiler: javac MyProgram.java. This generates a bytecode file MyProgram.class.
3 Execute the compiled bytecode using the java launcher: java MyProgram. The JVM loads and executes the bytecode.

6 Common Applications of Java
Android Applications for mobile devices.
Web Applications using frameworks like Spring and Servlets.
Enterprise Applications for large-scale business solutions.
Desktop Applications using AWT Swing or JavaFX.
Big Data Technologies like Hadoop and Spark.
Scientific Applications and research tools.

2025-12-01 → Features of Java
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on the features of Java for interview preparation.

1 Object Oriented
Java is a pure object oriented language. Everything in Java is an object. It supports the core principles of OOP such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.

2 Platform Independent
Java is platform independent meaning code compiled on one platform can run on any other platform without modification. This is achieved through Java bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine JVM. Write once run anywhere.

3 Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn and use. It eliminates complex features like explicit pointers operator overloading and multiple inheritance making the language simpler and less prone to errors.

4 Secure
Java provides a secure environment for application development. It includes features like a security manager bytecode verifier and no explicit pointers which helps prevent unauthorized access to system resources and memory corruption.

5 Robust
Java is a robust language built for reliability. It emphasizes strong memory management through automatic garbage collection and comprehensive exception handling mechanisms. It also has strong type checking to catch errors early.

6 Multithreaded
Java natively supports multithreading allowing multiple parts of a program to execute concurrently. This improves performance responsiveness and allows for the development of highly interactive applications.

7 High Performance
Java achieves high performance through its Just In Time JIT compiler. The JIT compiler converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime which significantly speeds up execution.

8 Distributed
Java is designed for the internet and distributed environments. It provides extensive networking capabilities and supports Remote Method Invocation RMI allowing applications to be distributed across networks.

9 Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language. It can adapt to an evolving environment by loading classes at runtime. It also supports reflection which allows examining and manipulating classes objects and methods at runtime.

10 Garbage Collected
Java provides automatic memory management through garbage collection. Programmers do not need to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory for objects. The garbage collector automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects preventing memory leaks.
