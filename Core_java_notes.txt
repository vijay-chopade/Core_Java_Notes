Java Introduction Interview Notes

1 What is Java
Java is a high-level object-oriented platform-independent programming language. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems now Oracle. Java is known for its robustness security and scalability in application development.

2 Key Features of Java
Object-Oriented Based on objects and classes supporting encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.
Platform Independent Write Once Run Anywhere WORA achieved through the Java Virtual Machine JVM.
Simple Designed with a clean syntax avoiding complex features like explicit pointers.
Secure Provides built-in security features bytecode verification and absence of explicit pointers.
Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and comprehensive exception handling.
Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
High Performance Achieved through Just-In-Time JIT compilers that optimize bytecode execution.
Distributed Designed for network-centric computing.

3 JVM JRE JDK Explained
JVM Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It is the component responsible for Java's platform independence.
JRE Java Runtime Environment Consists of the JVM and Java class libraries. It is necessary to run Java applications.
JDK Java Development Kit The complete development kit for Java. It includes the JRE a compiler javac debugger and other development tools needed to develop Java applications.

4 How Java achieves Platform Independence WORA
Java source code stored in a .java file is first compiled into platform-independent bytecode stored in a .class file by the javac compiler.
This bytecode is then interpreted and executed by the platform-specific JVM on the target operating system.
Since the bytecode is independent of the underlying hardware or operating system Java programs can run on any device with a compatible JVM without needing to be recompiled.

5 Basic Java Program Compilation and Execution Flow
1 Write your Java source code in a .java file for example MyProgram.java.
2 Compile the source code using the JDK's javac compiler: javac MyProgram.java. This generates a bytecode file MyProgram.class.
3 Execute the compiled bytecode using the java launcher: java MyProgram. The JVM loads and executes the bytecode.

6 Common Applications of Java
Android Applications for mobile devices.
Web Applications using frameworks like Spring and Servlets.
Enterprise Applications for large-scale business solutions.
Desktop Applications using AWT Swing or JavaFX.
Big Data Technologies like Hadoop and Spark.
Scientific Applications and research tools.
