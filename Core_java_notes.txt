----------------------------------------
Method Overriding

Method Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is a core concept of runtime polymorphism in Java.

Key points for interview preparation:

1.  Definition: A subclass defines a method with the same name, same parameters (signature), and same return type (or a covariant return type) as a method in its superclass.
2.  Inheritance Requirement: Overriding can only occur in a class that inherits from another class. There must be an "is-a" relationship.
3.  Method Signature: The overridden method in the subclass must have the exact same method name and parameter list as the method in the superclass.
4.  Return Type: The return type must be the same as the superclass method, or it can be a covariant return type (a subtype of the return type declared in the superclass method).
5.  Access Modifier: The access modifier of the overriding method cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method. For example, if a superclass method is protected, the subclass method can be protected or public, but not private or default.
6.  Exceptions: The overriding method cannot throw new or broader checked exceptions than the overridden method. It can throw narrower checked exceptions or no checked exceptions.
7.  Cannot Override:
    *   Static methods: Static methods cannot be overridden; they are hidden (method hiding).
    *   Final methods: Methods declared as final cannot be overridden.
    *   Private methods: Private methods are not accessible to subclasses, so they cannot be overridden.
8.  Abstract methods: If a superclass has an abstract method, its first concrete (non-abstract) subclass must provide an implementation for that method, effectively overriding it.
9.  Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding is the mechanism for achieving runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic method dispatch). The actual method called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type.
10. @Override Annotation: It is good practice to use the @Override annotation above the overriding method. This helps the compiler check if the method is indeed overriding a superclass method and makes the code more readable.
11. super keyword: The super keyword can be used within the overriding method to call the superclass's version of the method.
