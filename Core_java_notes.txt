Java Introduction Notes for Interview Preparation

1.  What is Java
    Java is a high level object oriented platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now owned by Oracle. It is known for its Write Once Run Anywhere capability. It is widely used for enterprise level applications mobile development especially Android web applications and big data technologies.

2.  History of Java
    Java was initially started by James Gosling and his team in 1991 as part of the Green Project. It was originally named Oak. It was later renamed Java in 1995.

3.  Key Features or Why Java
    1.  Platform Independent Code compiled on one OS can run on any other OS with a JVM.
    2.  Object Oriented Language based on classes and objects supports inheritance polymorphism abstraction and encapsulation.
    3.  Simple Syntax similar to C plus plus making it easier to learn.
    4.  Secure Strong security features including a sandbox environment and bytecode verifier.
    5.  Robust Strong memory management automatic garbage collection and exception handling.
    6.  Multithreaded Supports concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
    7.  High Performance Achieved through the Just In Time JIT compiler.
    8.  Distributed Designed for network based applications allowing for distributed computing.
    9.  Rich API and large community support.

4.  Java Platform Components
    1.  JVM Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It is responsible for converting Java bytecode into machine specific code and executing it. It also manages memory through garbage collection.
    2.  JRE Java Runtime Environment Contains the JVM and core class libraries. It is what you need to run Java applications. It does not include development tools.
    3.  JDK Java Development Kit Includes the JRE along with development tools like the compiler javac debugger jdb and archiver jar. It is what you need to develop Java applications.

5.  How Java Works Write Once Run Anywhere
    1.  Java source code written in a dot java file is compiled by the javac compiler into platform independent bytecode stored in a dot class file.
    2.  This bytecode can then be executed by any JVM on any operating system.
    3.  The JVM translates the bytecode into machine specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

6.  Basic Program Structure
    1.  Every Java program must have at least one class.
    2.  The entry point for execution of a Java application is the public static void main String[] args method.
    3.  Code statements typically end with a semicolon.

2025-12-01 → Features of Java
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on the features of Java for interview preparation

1  Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn and understand. It removes complex features found in other languages like explicit pointers operator overloading and multiple inheritance. This simplicity makes development faster and reduces errors.

2  Object-Oriented
Java fully embraces the object-oriented programming paradigm. Everything in Java except primitive types is an object. It supports core OOP concepts such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and abstraction.

3  Platform Independent
This is a key feature often described as Write Once Run Anywhere WORA. Java source code is compiled into bytecode which can then be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine JVM without modification.

4  Secure
Java is designed with security in mind. It provides a secure environment for running applications by using a security manager bytecode verifier and by eliminating explicit pointers to prevent unauthorized memory access.

5  Robust
Java is a robust language designed for reliability. It features strong memory management automatic garbage collection for memory cleanup and powerful exception handling mechanisms to prevent common programming errors and crashes.

6  Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading allowing multiple parts of a program to execute concurrently. This feature helps in building highly responsive and efficient applications by improving performance and resource utilization.

7  High Performance
Java achieves high performance through the use of Just-In-Time JIT compilers. The JIT compiler converts Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime which can then be executed at high speed.

8  Distributed
Java is designed for creating distributed applications. It has extensive networking capabilities and provides tools like Remote Method Invocation RMI which allows objects to communicate with each other across a network.

9  Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language meaning it can adapt to an evolving environment. It supports dynamic loading of classes allowing code to be updated on the fly without needing to recompile the entire application.

10 Portable
Due to its platform independence Java bytecode can be carried to any platform and executed without any modifications. This makes Java code highly portable across different operating systems and hardware.

11 Interpreted
While Java code is first compiled into bytecode this bytecode is then interpreted by the JVM at runtime. This interpretation step combined with JIT compilation contributes to its portability and helps with debugging.

2025-12-02 → JVM, JRE, JDK
----------------------------------------
JVM JRE JDK Short Notes for Interview Preparation

JVM

1 JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
2 It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
3 The JVM converts Java bytecode into machine specific language.
4 It is platform dependent. This means a JVM for Windows is different from a JVM for Linux.
5 Key functions include loading code verifying code executing code and managing memory through garbage collection.
6 It uses a Just In Time JIT compiler for performance optimization by compiling frequently used bytecode into native machine code.

JRE

1 JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
2 It is an implementation of the JVM.
3 JRE consists of the JVM plus a set of core libraries and other supporting files needed to run Java applications.
4 If you only want to run a Java program you need JRE.
5 JRE does not include development tools like compilers javac or debuggers.

JDK

1 JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
2 It is a software development environment used for developing Java applications.
3 JDK includes the JRE and a set of development tools.
4 If you want to develop and run Java programs you need JDK.
5 Key development tools included are javac the compiler java the application launcher jar the archiver and javadoc the documentation generator.

Relationship

1 The relationship can be seen as a nested structure.
2 JDK contains JRE.
3 JRE contains JVM.
4 So the hierarchy is JDK contains JRE which contains JVM.
5 JDK is for both developing and running Java applications.
6 JRE is solely for running Java applications.
7 JVM is the core component that executes the bytecode.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-06 → Java Installation
----------------------------------------
Java Installation Notes for Interview Preparation

1.  Java installation involves setting up the Java Development Kit JDK on your system. This enables you to write, compile, and run Java applications.

2.  Understanding JDK and JRE:
    *   JDK Java Development Kit: Essential for Java developers. It includes the Java Runtime Environment JRE, a compiler javac, debuggers, and other development tools.
    *   JRE Java Runtime Environment: Used by end-users to run Java applications. It contains the Java Virtual Machine JVM and core class libraries.

3.  Installation Steps:
    *   Download JDK: Obtain the correct JDK version for your operating system from official sources like Oracle or OpenJDK distributions.
    *   Run Installer: Execute the downloaded installer file and follow the guided prompts. The installer will place Java files in a default location, for example C:\Program Files\Java.
    *   Configure Environment Variables:
        *   JAVA_HOME: Create a new system environment variable named JAVA_HOME. Set its value to the root directory of your JDK installation, for example C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.
        *   PATH: Append %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your system's PATH environment variable. This enables running Java commands like java and javac from any command prompt location.
    *   Verify Installation: Open a command prompt or terminal and type `java -version` and `javac -version`. Both commands should display the installed Java version successfully.

4.  Important Commands and Concepts:
    *   javac: The Java compiler. It converts .java source code files into .class bytecode files.
    *   java: The Java application launcher. It executes .class bytecode files using the JVM.
    *   JVM Java Virtual Machine: An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It is the core component of the JRE and enables Java's platform independence.
    *   JAVA_HOME vs PATH: JAVA_HOME explicitly points to the JDK root directory, which is often used by build tools. PATH tells the operating system where to find executable commands like java and javac.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-10 → First Java Program
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on First Java Program suitable for interview preparation.

1 Every Java application must have at least one class definition. This class will contain the main method.

2 The file containing your Java source code should be saved with a .java extension. The class containing the main method should typically have the same name as the file for simplicity and convention (e.g., MyProgram.java contains class MyProgram).

3 The main method is the entry point for any Java application. The Java Virtual Machine JVM starts execution from this method. Its signature is always public static void mainString[] args.

4 Breakdown of the main method signature:
   public: An access specifier making the method visible to the JVM.
   static: Allows the main method to be called without creating an object of the class. It belongs to the class itself.
   void: Indicates that the main method does not return any value.
   main: The name of the method recognized by the JVM as the application's entry point.
   String[] args: An array of String objects that can receive command line arguments passed to the program.

5 To print output to the console, we use System.out.println("Your message here");.
   System: A final class from the java.lang package.
   out: A static member of the System class, an instance of PrintStream.
   println: A method of the PrintStream class that prints a string and then a new line character.

6 Steps to compile and run your first Java program:
   Write the source code in a text editor and save it as MyProgram.java.
   Open a terminal or command prompt.
   Compile the program using the Java compiler: javac MyProgram.java. This command translates the source code into bytecode and creates a .class file (e.g., MyProgram.class).
   Execute the program using the Java launcher: java MyProgram. This command tells the JVM to load and execute the bytecode from the MyProgram.class file.

7 Key concepts demonstrated by the first program:
   JVM Java Virtual Machine: The runtime environment that executes Java bytecode.
   JRE Java Runtime Environment: Contains the JVM and standard libraries needed to run Java applications.
   JDK Java Development Kit: Includes the JRE and development tools like the javac compiler, needed to develop Java applications.
   Bytecode: The platform-independent intermediate code generated by the compiler.
   Platform Independence: Java's write once, run anywhere WORA capability, where bytecode can be executed on any platform with a compatible JVM.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-12 → Java Syntax
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on Java Syntax suitable for interview preparation.

1 Program Structure
 Every Java application must have at least one class.
 The main method public static void mainString[] args is the entry point for execution.
 All code resides within classes.

2 Keywords and Identifiers
 Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in Java. Examples include public static class int void if for.
 Identifiers are names given to classes methods variables and packages. They must start with a letter underscore or dollar sign and cannot be keywords. Java is case sensitive so myVar and MyVar are different identifiers.

3 Data Types
 Primitive types are fundamental types that store simple values. These include byte short int long float double char and boolean.
 Reference types refer to objects. Examples include String Arrays and any user-defined class or interface.

4 Variables
 Declaration involves specifying the type and name of the variable e.g. int age;.
 Initialization assigns an initial value to a variable e.g. age = 30;.
 Declaration and initialization can be combined e.g. String name = "Java";.
 Constants are declared using the final keyword e.g. final double PI = 3.14;.

5 Operators
 Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations: + - * / % ++ --.
 Relational operators compare values and return a boolean: == != > < >= <=.
 Logical operators combine boolean expressions: && || !.
 Assignment operators assign values: = += -= *= /= % =.
 Conditional Ternary operator: condition ? expression1 : expression2.

6 Control Flow Statements
 Selection statements execute code blocks based on conditions: if if-else if-else if-else and switch.
 Iteration or loop statements repeat a block of code: for while do-while and for-each.
 Jump statements alter the flow of a loop or method: break continue and return.

7 Methods
 Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
 Declaration syntax: accessModifier returnType methodNameparameters { // method body }.
 To call a method you use its name followed by arguments if any: object.methodNamearguments; or ClassName.staticMethodNamearguments;.

8 Access Modifiers
 Control the visibility and accessibility of classes methods and variables.
 public visible everywhere.
 protected visible within the package and to subclasses.
 default no keyword visible only within the same package.
 private visible only within the declared class.

9 Comments
 Used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler.
 Single-line comments start with // e.g. // This is a comment.
 Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ e.g. /* This is a multi-line comment */.
 Documentation comments start with /** and end with */ used for generating API documentation.

10 Basic Syntax Rules
 Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon ;.
 Code blocks are defined by curly braces {} e.g. for class method and loop bodies.
 The name of the Java source file must exactly match the name of the public class it contains.
 Java is case-sensitive.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-19 → Data Types
----------------------------------------
Java Data Types

1 Primitive Data Types
 These are the basic building blocks in Java. They directly hold the actual values and are stored in the stack memory.
 Each primitive type has a fixed size in memory.
 There are 8 primitive data types in Java:

 1 byte 8-bit signed integer. Range is -128 to 127. Default value 0.
 2 short 16-bit signed integer. Range is -32,768 to 32,767. Default value 0.
 3 int 32-bit signed integer. Most commonly used for whole numbers. Range is approximately +/- 2 billion. Default value 0.
 4 long 64-bit signed integer. For very large whole numbers. Default value 0L.
 5 float 32-bit single-precision floating-point number. For decimal numbers. Default value 0.0f.
 6 double 64-bit double-precision floating-point number. Most commonly used for decimal numbers. Default value 0.0d.
 7 char 16-bit Unicode character. Represents a single character. Default value '\u0000'.
 8 boolean Represents true or false. Default value false.

 Primitive types are passed by value.

2 Non-Primitive Data Types Reference Data Types
 These do not directly hold values. Instead, they hold references memory addresses to objects which are stored in the heap memory.
 Their size is not fixed and varies depending on the object they refer to.
 Examples include:

 1 String A sequence of characters.
 2 Arrays Collections of similar types of data.
 3 Classes User-defined blueprints for objects.
 4 Interfaces Blueprints for classes.
 5 Enums Special classes representing a group of constants.

 The default value for non-primitive types is null.
 Non-primitive types are passed by reference effectively the reference itself is passed by value.

3 Key Differences Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Types
 1 Storage Primitive types store actual values. Non-primitive types store references to objects.
 2 Memory Primitive types are stored on the stack. Non-primitive objects are stored on the heap.
 3 Size Primitive types have fixed sizes. Non-primitive types have variable sizes.
 4 Default Value Primitive types have specific default values 0, false, '\u0000'. Non-primitive types default to null.
 5 Performance Accessing primitive types is generally faster as values are directly available.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-20 → Variables
----------------------------------------
1 Variables Definition
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It acts as a container to store data values. Its value can be changed during program execution.

2 Characteristics
Every variable has a data type, a name, and a value.
The data type determines the kind of data it can store example integer text and the operations that can be performed.
The name is used to identify and refer to the variable in the code.

3 Declaration and Initialization
Declaration involves specifying the variable's data type and name. Example int quantity;
Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a declared variable. Example quantity = 100;
Declaration and initialization can occur together. Example int quantity = 100;

4 Types of Variables in Java
Java categorizes variables into three main types based on their declaration location and behavior.

4.1 Instance Variables non static fields
These are declared inside a class but outside any method constructor or block.
Each object or instance of the class will have its own copy of these variables.
They represent the unique state of an object.
If not explicitly initialized they are assigned default values 0 for numeric types false for boolean null for object references.

4.2 Static Variables class variables
These are declared inside a class but outside any method constructor or block using the static keyword.
There is only one copy of a static variable per class shared by all instances of that class.
They are associated with the class itself rather than any specific object.
Like instance variables they receive default values if not explicitly initialized.

4.3 Local Variables
These are declared inside a method constructor or a block of code.
They are local to that specific block and cannot be accessed from outside it.
Local variables must be explicitly initialized before they are used. The Java compiler will report an error if an uninitialized local variable is used.
Their scope and lifetime are limited to the block in which they are declared.

5 Naming Conventions
Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
They typically follow the camelCase convention where the first letter of the first word is lowercase and the first letter of subsequent words is uppercase example employeeId annualSalary.
Names must begin with a letter an underscore or a dollar sign. Subsequent characters can include digits.

6 Scope and Lifetime
Scope defines the region of the program where a variable can be accessed.
Lifetime refers to how long a variable exists in memory.
Instance variables have object scope and their lifetime is tied to the object's existence.
Static variables have class scope and exist as long as the class is loaded in the JVM.
Local variables have block scope and exist only while their respective block is being executed.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-23 → Input and Output
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on Java Input and Output suitable for interview preparation:

1 Java I/O is based on streams. A stream represents a sequence of data.
2 Input streams read data, and output streams write data.

3 Java I/O streams are categorized into two main types:
    a Byte Streams for raw binary data.
    b Character Streams for text data.

4 Byte Streams
    a Abstract classes are InputStream and OutputStream.
    b Operate on 8-bit bytes.
    c Used for reading and writing any type of binary data, like images, audio, or compiled classes.
    d Common concrete classes: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, DataInputStream, DataOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream.

5 Character Streams
    a Abstract classes are Reader and Writer.
    b Operate on 16-bit Unicode characters.
    c Automatically handle character encodings, making them suitable for internationalized text.
    d Common concrete classes: FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, InputStreamReader, OutputStreamWriter.

6 Key Stream Types and Their Uses:
    a File Streams: FileInputStream/FileOutputStream (bytes) and FileReader/FileWriter (characters) to interact with files on the disk.
    b Buffered Streams: BufferedReader/BufferedWriter and BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream. They improve performance by buffering data, reducing the number of actual I/O operations. They wrap other streams.
    c Data Streams: DataInputStream/DataOutputStream. Allow reading and writing primitive Java data types (like int, double, boolean) in a portable way.
    d Object Streams (Serialization): ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream. Used to read and write entire Java objects to/from a stream.
        i Objects must implement the java.io.Serializable interface to be serialized.
        ii The transient keyword can be used to mark fields that should not be serialized.
        iii serialVersionUID is used for version control of serialized objects.

7 Stream Chaining (Decorators):
    a Streams are often chained or wrapped around each other to add functionality. For example, a BufferedReader can wrap a FileReader to add buffering capabilities to file reading.
    b Example: new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))

8 Closing Streams:
    a It is crucial to close streams to release system resources.
    b The preferred way to ensure streams are closed is by using the try-with-resources statement introduced in Java 7. This automatically closes any resource that implements the AutoCloseable interface.
    c Before Java 7, streams were typically closed in a finally block.

9 NIO.2 (New I/O APIs):
    a Introduced in Java 7 in the java.nio.file package.
    b Provides a more modern, flexible, and efficient way to handle file I/O operations.
    c Key classes include Path for representing file system paths and Files for performing common file operations (copy, move, delete, read/write).
    d Supports features like asynchronous I/O, file system monitoring, and symbolic links.
========================================

========================================
2025-12-24 → Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise, Ternary)
----------------------------------------
Here are short notes on Java Operators suitable for interview preparation.

Operators in Java are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

1 Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations.
Addition (+) Adds two operands.
Subtraction (-) Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Multiplication (*) Multiplies two operands.
Division (/) Divides the first operand by the second. For integer types, it performs integer division truncating any fractional part.
Modulo (%) Computes the remainder of a division.
Increment (++) Increases the value of an operand by 1. Can be prefix or postfix.
Decrement (--) Decreases the value of an operand by 1. Can be prefix or postfix.

2 Logical Operators

These operators are used with boolean values to evaluate conditions.
Logical AND (&&) Returns true if both operands are true. It is a short-circuit operator meaning if the first operand is false, the second is not evaluated.
Logical OR (||) Returns true if at least one operand is true. It is a short-circuit operator meaning if the first operand is true, the second is not evaluated.
Logical NOT (!) Reverses the boolean value of its operand. True becomes false and false becomes true.
Bitwise AND (&) Can also be used as a non-short-circuit logical AND. Both operands are always evaluated.
Bitwise OR (|) Can also be used as a non-short-circuit logical OR. Both operands are always evaluated.
All logical operators work with boolean operands and return a boolean result.

3 Bitwise Operators

These operators perform operations on individual bits of integer types (byte, short, int, long).
Bitwise AND (&) Sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.
Bitwise OR (|) Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
Bitwise XOR (^) Sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.
Bitwise NOT (~) Inverts all bits of its operand (one's complement).
Left Shift (<<) Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions. Fills empty positions with zeros on the right.
Signed Right Shift (>>) Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions. Fills empty positions with the sign bit on the left (maintains sign).
Unsigned Right Shift (>>>) Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions. Fills empty positions with zeros on the left (does not maintain sign).

4 Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)

This is the only ternary operator in Java, meaning it takes three operands.
Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2
Description: It evaluates the 'condition'. If the condition is true, 'expression1' is evaluated and its value is returned. If the condition is false, 'expression2' is evaluated and its value is returned. It provides a concise way to write simple if-else statements.
========================================
